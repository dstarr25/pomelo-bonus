# Pomelo Bonus!

For a bonus add-on to the credit card payment coding assessment, I created a backend api server with Bun.js (download [here](https://bun.sh/)) that allows you to send http requests to make the six different kinds of changes to your credit account as they were in the coding assessment. 

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run locally:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```
